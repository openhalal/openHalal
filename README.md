Internet is get small for the those who want adhere to the principal of Islam, it can be as simple as to buy something, read news, chat with friends and all the halal things one can do, but to have a free mind while doing such things is getting tedious.

While your buying even if you want buy directly, they prompt you for continuously for EMI (a form of Ribba).

While reading news, they will prompt you for different celebrities.

While chating with friends, they will prompt you to talk to some strangers.  

the Internet is shrinking in what we can do everyday and it feels like everthing is haram.


Abu Sa’id reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “The honest and trustworthy merchant will be with the prophets, the truthful, and the martyrs.” -- [Source: Sunan al-Tirmidhī 1209]
